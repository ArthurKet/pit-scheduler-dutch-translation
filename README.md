# pit-scheduler-dutch-translation
only dutch translation for pit-scheduler created by Chuck Durst
This repository is created to use with pit-scheduler 
I am just using github for the first time and do not know any other way to contact Chuck and donate the translation. 
I hope he find's the file and adds it to his own pit-scheduler repository
